# General
## Sections
A section is a group of rules. What happens to the result of a section depends on the choice of the `Operator` of the section's first rule.

### Adding new sections
The `New section` button is only available if all rules are completed. 

# Creating rules
## Adding rules
Adding a rule is done by using the `Add` button next to a section title. If the button is not available, this means your current rule isn't finished yet.

A rule consists of at least 4 values. If the `second value` contains a custom value, a `custom value` parameter will also pop up.

Starting from the second rule or section, a `operator` parameter is also required. Here you must specify the action to take on the results of the previous rule. 
  

| Param        | Description           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Operator   | Action to take on the previous rule or section |
| First value   | The first value to compare with |
| Action        | The comparable action to take |
| Second value| The second value to compare with |
| Custom value| A custom value input |
